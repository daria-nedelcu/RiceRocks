Classic game of Asteroids in Python


This game was developed as part of an assignment for Rice University's 
course Interactive Programming in Python. Due to it being developed on 
an online platform, it might not run in every Python IDE. Therefore, 
the easiest way to run this program is to access this link[1] and click Run.
It is also recommended that this be run in the Chrome/Firefox browser.


This is an implementation of the classic game of Asteroids. The controls
are as follows:
'SPACE' - shoot missile
'UP' - accelerate
'LEFT' - rotate ship left
'RIGHT' - rotate ship right

The player starts the game with three lives. For each asteroid that hits
the ship one life is deducted. For each asteroid that is hit by a missile
the score in the upper right corner increases. When the lives run out
the game restarts.
